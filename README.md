## TuneInLater
TuneInLater is a full stack web app where users can log in and browse audiobooks and then save their favorites to a database for later. This app was created in less than a week by Jacob Ogren and Alek Aker using React/Redux on the frontend and Node/Postgres on the backend.

## Learning Goals
- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Become comfortable with different network requests like GET, POST, & DELETE.
- Solidify concepts with React to create clean and re-useable components.
- Become comfortable with Reduxâ€™s lifecycle, creating actions, reducers, and connecting them to React components.
- Understand and solidify concepts with React component, asynchronous code, route handling, and Redux testing.

## Tech
- React
- Redux
- React-Router
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- Node
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin
- Testing with Enzyme and Jest.
